      <p>I've worked as an enrolled agent and American tax preparer for the past eight years. Always searching for new
        knowledge and a fast learner. Born and raised in Argentina, I'm also an American citizen; fluent in English,
        Spanish, Portuguese and learning Dutch at the moment. I am based in Amsterdam with full EU working rights.
        Lifelong
        learner.</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>Enrolled agents, like attorneys and certified public accountants (CPAs), have unlimited practice rights. This means
    I am unrestricted as to which taxpayers I can represent, what types of tax matters I can handle, and before which
    IRS offices I can represent clients.</p>
